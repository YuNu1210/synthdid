\title{Computes the synthetic diff-in-diff estimate for an average treatment effect on the treated with staggered adoption.}

\usage{
synth_did_staggered_treatment(data, initial_treat_var, untreated, 
                               outcome_var, unit, treatment_var, time_var)
}

\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataframe.}

\item{initial_treat_var}{Column that contains initial treatment time period.}

\item{untreated}{Value assigned in treatment_var column to the untreated units.}

\item{outcome_var}{Column that contains y variable.}

\item{unit}{Column that identifies each unit.}

\item{treatment_var}{Column that denotes the treatment status for each unit where 1 if unit is treated in that period.}

\item{time_var}{Time period variable.}
}

\value{
An average treatment effect estimate with 'weights' and 'setup' attached as attributes.
'weights' contains the estimated weights lambda and omega and corresponding intercepts,
as well as regression coefficients beta if X is passed.
'setup' is a list describing the problem passed in: data, initial_treat_year, untreated, outcome_var, unit, treatment_year, time_var.
